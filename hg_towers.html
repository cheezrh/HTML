			<h2><u>Rule an Ancient City</u></h2>
		</center>
			<p>Towers and Temples is the winner of the 2017 Palmer 
			Medal for Best New Simulation Board Game. 
			Players adopt role cards of characters from ancient 
			Greece and Rome in an attempt to manage 
			the administration of a city. Each role provides 
			a different ability and strategy. However, 
			one role card belongs to a deadly assassin and players 
			must be constantly aware of betrayal 
			and double-cross. This card game provides a ton 
			of enjoyment and can handle up to eight players 
			and expansion packs available for larger parties.</p>
			<p>This is a nicely balanced game, where each player must 
			carefully choose his or her roles and 
			the strategies can quickly change with the turn 
			of a card. However the level of randomness is 
			just right and cunning and resourcefulness can 
			overcome bad luck (if given time.) I do not 
			recommend this game unless there are at least 4 
			players; less than that reduces the intrigue 
			and some of the game appeal.</p>

		Towers and Temples is a great game. The balance is 
		just about perfect and each player must 
		carefully choose roles each turn. Even though the 
		strategic possibilities are nearly endless, 
		the game is simple to learn. The replay value is 
		high and gets even better when you replace 
		some of the cards with new cards available in the 
		expansion packs.

			<h2>
				<u><b>Great Strategic Board Game</b></u>
			</h2>
		</center>
		<p>
		We tested Towers and Temples with everything from 2 
to 6 players and we can strongly 
recommend the game. The different phases of the 
game are interesting and intriguing, from
bluffing and stealing to site construction and planning. 
With the variety of cards and 
scenarios, no two games are ever quite the same. It's 
a great introduction to the world of 
strategic board games and role playing.

				<u><b>An Incredible Game</b></u>
			</h2>

		The artwork on the cards and the board is excellent 
and one of the best around. As 
for play, this game offers lots of strategy, and there 
are tough decisions to make every 
turn. It's not only important to select the character 
that increases your chances for scoring, 
but also to anticipate the characters the opponents 
are likely to select, and then hedge against 
their availability. This causes a lot of unpredictability 
and deep strategic thinking. However, 
it can still be played at a more basic level for 
younger users.<br>

We had a lot of fun with this game and rate it as 
Best in its Class. Highly recommended.
