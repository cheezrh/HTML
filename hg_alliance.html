			<h2><u>Decide the Fate of the World</u></h2>
		</center>
		
			<p>Alliance challenges you and your opponents to decide 
			the outcome. As one of the world powers 
			battling for supremacy you must lead your country's
			 military drive; but you can't do it alone. 
			You have to form alliances and then betray your 
			allies before they betray you! <br>

			Decide where to strike, when to strike, and the intensity
			 of the strike. Will it be a bombing 
			raid, an offshore missile barrage, or an invasion 
			with land forces and tanks? Plan your attack, 
			move into enemy territory with your forces and win 
			the conflict.<br>

			The economic destiny of your nation is also at stake. 
			Buy armaments and develop secret 
			weapons from your country's economic funds and 
			natural reserves, but be sure to save 
			something for the future.<br>

				<h2>
					<u>Tedious and Confusing</u>
				</h2>
			</center>
			<p>
			The list of war simulation games is long. All of them 
			share similar features including the 
			formation of temporary Alliance and battles simulated 
			through random draws of a deck or the 
			roll of the die. Alliance offers very little that 
			is new or innovative in that regard.<br>

			We found the game to be too drawn-out and confusing. 
			In fact, I dare say we spent more time 
			reading and rereading the rule book than actually 
			playing the game. If you want to read a 
			book on war, we suggest Sun Tzu.

				<h2>
					<u>Decent Game but Many are Better</u>
				</h2>
			</center>
			<p>
			Alliance is a good war simulation game. We found the 
			game play to be robust and engaging. The 
			rules are long and drawn out but, for anyone with 
			experience in this class of board games, there 
			is little there that's unexpected or difficult. We 
			think the battle simulation cards are some of 
			the best we have encountered.<br>

			All of that being said, the competition for this type 
			of game is fierce. There are a lot of 
			established titles with loyal clients. We're not 
			exactly sure where Alliance fits in with 
			that group. It's a good game, but not good enough 
			to draw our attention away from games like 
			Battle Tested and Global Conflict.<br>

				<h2>
					<u>Fun and Challenging</u>
				</h2>
			</center>
			<p>
			Alliance is fun game and is sure to appeal to 
			war game enthusiasts. We think it offers several new 
			ideas that we're surprised have not been utilized in other simulation games. The card system and the 
			investment options give the game a "real world" feel.

			This is a great game for anyone 16 years or older. Younger players may have trouble with the rules and may be bored.
